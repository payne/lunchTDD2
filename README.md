All tests `bin/rspec` pass!  Next up, some many to many relationships and more tests!!!

This application uses things I have learned from
Rem Zolotykh (@remzolotykh) in his class:
https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/test-driven-rails-rspec-capybara-cucumber/table-of-contents

I think the table relationships have error(s).
